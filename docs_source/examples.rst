examples
===================

.. note::

    Mode and coupling coefficient plots may not look the same when you try to run the examples on your machine, if there are modes degenerate in eigenvalue. In these cases, the choice of eigenbasis is determined by the mesh; and different installations of ``Gmsh`` may produce different meshes for the same inputs. However, the physics is the same regardless of the choice of basis.

Below is a collection of examples, ordered mostly in increasing complexity. These examples may use workflows covered in :doc:`advanced usage <advancedusage>` or functions documented in :doc:`reference <reference>`.
