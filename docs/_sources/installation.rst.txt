installation
===================

You will need both a Python3 and a `Julia <https://julialang.org/downloads/>`_ installation.

First make sure you download the following dependencies:

**General**: ``Gmsh`` (download  `here <https://gmsh.info/>`_)

**Python**: ``numpy``, ``scipy``, ``juliacall``, ``wavesolve``, ``pygmsh``, ``meshio``, ``matplotlib`` (All ``pip`` installable by name besides ``wavesolve``, download `here <https://github.com/jw-lin/wavesolve>`_)

Next, run the following to install the Python module and grab the Julia source code: ::

    pip install git+https://github.com/jw-lin/cbeam.git

To get the Julia dependencies and precompile the Julia code, after importing ``cbeam`` you can run :: 

    cbeam.FEvalsetup()

e.g. in an IPython session. The only Julia dependency is ``PythonCall``. 

To update ``cbeam``, run ::

    pip install --upgrade git+https://github.com/jw-lin/cbeam.git

When updating, you should re-run ``cbeam.FEvalsetup()``.
