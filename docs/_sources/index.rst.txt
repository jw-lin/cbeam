cbeam documentation
===================

**cbeam** is a Python/Julia package which simulates the propagation of light through slowly varying waveguides. It has a completely Pythonic interface, and uses coupled-mode theory under the hood; if you're interested in the math, check out the arXiv paper `here <https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08118>`_. 

If you have questions, suggestions, or would like to contribute, feel free reach out. 

.. note::

The **cbeam** package and corresponding documentation are still under active development. Currently, the package is tailored for weakly-guiding structures (low index contrast) and unidirectional/paraxial propagation, and can simulate photonic lanterns and simple directional couplers without much hassle. More complicated geometries such as multimode interferometers can also be simulated if they are broken into segments - but I am looking at how this can be streamlined. Scenarios where back reflection is important (e.g. fiber Bragg gratings) are currently not supported.
