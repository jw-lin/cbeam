    "## 0. What is `coupledbeam`?\n",
    "\n",
    "`coupledbeam` simulates the propagation of light through slowly-varying tapered waveguides using the coupled-mode approach. When applicable, this approach is typically much faster than alternate techniques like the finite difference beam propagation method (FD-BPM). `coupledbeam` is mostly written in Python, and has a completely Pythonic interface, with some parts written in Julia. In this notebook, we'll go over installation instructions, give some starting examples, and provide basic documentation."

    "#### 1.2 **How it works**\n",
    "\n",
    "Below we provide a high-level overview of how the code works.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1.** To solve for the instantaneous eigenmodes of the waveguide at a given $z$ coordinate (which we define as the propagation direction), we use `wavesolve`, a Python package that applies the finite element method over quadratic triangle meshes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2.** To generate meshes corresponding to the waveguide refractive index profile at $z$, we use `pygmsh`/`Gmsh`. **Only waveguides with step-index profiles are currently supported**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3.** To simulate tapered waveguides, meshes are continuously evolved forward in $z$ by rescaling all mesh points. **Only tapered waveguides that can be represented this way are currently fully supported**. (Though it can be possible to simulate other kinds of waveguides with a little more work. I plan on extending functionality in the future. Probably will require an implementation of mesh generation with user-defined symmetries.)\n",
    "\n",
    "**4.** In order to quickly evaluate a FE mode field at an arbitrary $(x,y)$ point, `coupledbeam` includes `FEval`, a simple Julia package that implements bounding volume hierarchy (BVH) trees. These structures are used to store mesh triangles, for faster lookup. (There are probably much better implementations out there which I might switch to in the future.)  \n",
    "\n",
    "**5.** To quickly integrate functions involving FE modes (i.e. to take inner products), we use the `GrundmanMoeller` Julia package.\n",
    "\n",
    "**6.** The initial value problem corresponding to the coupled-mode equations is solved using standard Runge-Kutta schemes, as implemented through `SciPy`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.3 **Code structure**\n",
    "\n",
    "`coupledbeam` provides the following modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "> `waveguide` : one of two main modules, used to define waveguides.\n",
    "\n",
    "> `propagator` : the second main module, used to define propagation parameters and run propagations.\n",
    "\n",
    "> `FEval` : the \"finite element evaluation\" module, comprised of Julia source code and a Python wrapper unless you want to resample eigenmodes (e.g. onto rectangular grids).\n",

    "## 2. How to use `coupledbeam`\n",
    "\n",
    "Broadly speaking, using `coupledbeam` is a two-step process: we first define a waveguide using the `waveguide` module, and then define a set of parameters for the numerical using the `propagator` module.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 **Defining waveguides**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.1.1 ***the `Prim2D` class***\n",
    "\n",
    "The most basic parent class that represents a refractive index geometry is a `Prim2D`. Each `Prim2D` specifies the boundary of a closed region - through an array of $(x,y)$ points - and a refractive index value corresponding to the interior that region. Physically, these boundaries represent material interfaces in the waveguide. A `Prim2D` is generically initialized through\n",
    "\n",
    "`prim2D = waveguide.Prim2D(points,n)`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Arguments**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `points` : an $N\\times 2$ array of $(x,y)$ points corresponding to a material interface. (The first and last point are automatically connected.)\n",
    "2.  `n` : the refractive index inside the region bounded by `points`. \n",
    "\n",
    "To simulate complex waveguide geometries, users are encouraged to define subclasses that inherit from `Prim2D`. Such classes can have there own `__init__()` functions, but should define a function `make_points()`, which takes in some set of args and returns an array `points`.  An example subclass of `waveguide.Prim2D` that is already implemented is `waveguide.Circle`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.1.2 ***the `Prim3D` class***\n",
    "\n",
    "The next level in complexity is the `Prim3D` parent class, which is essentially a `Prim2D` combined with a function that dictates evolution with respect to $z$. A `Prim3D` is generically initialized as \n",
    "\n",
    "`prim3D = waveguide.Prim2D(prim2D,label)`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Arguments**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `prim2D` : a `Prim2D` object representing the cross-section of the `Prim3D`\n",
    "2. `label` : a user-specified identifying string to attach to the physical region bounded by `prim2D.points` (e.g. \"core\" or \"cladding\" for a step-index fiber.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheriting classes must implement the function `update(z)`, which updates `prim2D` to the desired $z$ coordinate. An example subclass of `waveguide.Prim3D` is `waveguide.Pipe`, which can be used to represent geometries where the cross-section remains circular at all $z$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.1.3 ***the `Waveguide` class***\n",
    "\n",
    "At the highest level, waveguides are defined through the `Waveguide` parent class. `Waveguide` objects are essentially nested lists of `Prim3D` objects: something like `[[p1,p2],[p3,p4,p5],[p6]]` where `p1,p2,...` are individual `Prim3D` object (the exact shape will vary). The refractive index geometry generated by the first set of primitives is overwritten by the next, and so on. A `Waveguide` is generically initialized as \n",
    "\n",
    "`wvg = Waveguide(prim3Dgroups)` \n",
    "\n",
    "where `prim3Dgroups` is the nested list of 3D primitives mentioned above.\n",
    "\n",
    "All `Waveguide` objects have three main class functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "> `Waveguide.update(z)` : this function updates the waveguide to a given $z$ coordinate, returning `None`. The base behavior of this function is to call `update` on every `Prim3D` in the waveguide.\n",
    "\n",
    "> `Waveguide.make_mesh()` : this function is implemented by the base class and returns a quadratic triangle finite element mesh correspodning to the cross-sectional structure of the waveguide at the current $z$ coordinate.\n",
    "\n",
    "> `Waveguide.assign_IOR()` : this *static* function returns a dictionary `IOR_dict` that maps each labelled region in the mesh to a refractive index value. The keys of this dictionary are the labels of the `Prim3D` objects composing the waveguide. Must be implemented by the inheriting class.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There is also a more advanced mesh-generating function, `Waveguide.make_mesh_bndry_ref()`, which is similar to the usual `make_mesh()` function with the added option of adaptively refining the mesh in regions near material interfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ***2.1.4 An example waveguide - the `PhotonicLantern` class***\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of a `Waveguide` subclass is the `PhotonicLantern` class. This class of waveguide is composed of three groups of primitives: a single outer `Pipe` corresponding to lantern jacket, a single inner `Pipe` corresponding to the lantern cladding, and a set of small `Pipe`s embedded within the cladding - the cores. This class has a custom `__init__()` function which automatically generates and arranges `Pipe`s based on parameters like core radius, cladding radius, and core position(s). See `waveguide.PhotonicLantern` for more details. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### ***2.1.5 Utility functions for `Waveguides`***\n",
    "Below we list some useful functions implemented by the base `Waveguide` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "> `plot_boundaries()` : plot all boundaries (material interfaces) in the waveguide, at the currently updated $z$ coordinate.\n",
    "\n",
    "> `plot_mesh()` : generate and plot a mesh for the waveguide. You can also explicitly pass in a mesh, produced e.g. by `Waveguide.make_mesh()`, as well as refractive index information, through the optional args `mesh` and `IOR_dict`."

    "3. `Nmax` : the number of propagating modes in this waveguide (we cannot at the moment treat radiative modes)\n",
    "4. `save_dir` : the local path for where data should be saved. The default is `\"./data\"`. Folders will be created if they are not found.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ***2.2.2 \"Characterizing\" the waveguide***\n",

    "* the cross-coupling matrix (formed from the inner product of eigenmodes and eigenmode derivatives.)\n",

    "This step takes the bulk of the time when it comes to waveguide simulation; however, once we have the above, propagation of any guided wavefront through the waveguide is fast.

    "There are also a number of optional arguments related to computation details.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Optional arguments**\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `tol` : this tolerance parameter controls the adaptive stepping. Smaller = more careful stepping. Values are typically in the 1e-4 to 1e-6 range (default 1e-5).\n",
    "4. `dz0` : this is the fixed $z$ step used to estimate derivatives via centered finite difference. Default is 0.1, but might need to be changed depending on your choice of spatial units.\n",
    "5. `min_zstep` : this is the minimum `z` step that can be chosen by the adaptive scheme. Computation will halt when the stepsize drops below this value. Default 1. Certain meshes sometimes perform poorly an trigger a halt - in these cases you can try remeshing with different parameters and rerunning. (Unfortunately I don't have a better solution atm!)\n",
    "6. `save` : set to True to write all computation results to file. These can be loaded later with `prop.load(tag)`, where `tag` is defined as below\n",
    "7. `tag` : a string tag to attach to output files so that they can be loaded later.\n",
    "8. `fixed_degen` : a nested list of indices (starting from 0) which identify degenerate mode groups. For instance, if we know *a priori* that modes (1,2) and modes (3,4) form degenerate pairs, we could pass in `fixed_degen=[[1,2],[3,4]]`. This can speed up computation (and resolve issues with `min_zstep`).\n",
    "9. `fixed_step` : set this to a numeric value to used a fixed $z$ step, bypassing the adaptive scheme.\n",
